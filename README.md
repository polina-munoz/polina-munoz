I'm a Software Engineer at [Chime](https://www.chime.com/careers/). I have been working on software professionally for 5+ years now, most recently building backend services in Ruby.

Areas of focus:

- Building reliable and safe distributed systems for high volume payment processing.
- Being thoughtful about data architecture and MySQL/datastore performance tuning.
- Knowing what a [good API](https://increment.com/apis/) looks like.
- Promoting active redistribution of [experience points](https://deniseyu.io/2020/05/23/habits-of-high-performing-teams.html).
- Writing code with an emphasis on clarity and maintainability.
- Jumping into situations with few guardrails to make things better for the team.
- Excited about expanding my knowledge of U.S. payments infrastructure and sharing [my learnings](https://github.com/polina-soshnin/polina-soshnin/blob/master/payments_resources.md) with different audiences, especially to empower those who work in payment operations.
